Simulacrum data release, version 2.1.0-2016-2019, 2023-04-21

This is a package of synthetic data based on cancer registration data from 
the National Cancer Registration Dataset (NCRD), the Systemic Anti-Cancer 
Treatment (SACT) dataset, the Radiotherapy Dataset (RTDS) and genomics testing 
data collected by the National Disease Registration Service (NDRS), NHS England. 
The synthetic data was developed by Health Data Insight CiC.

Any analysis performed on this synthetic data will not produce outputs that 
correspond exactly to analysis performed on the real data. The synthetic data 
does not contain real patients but just mimics the data structure and specific 
statistical properties of the real data. To minimise the potential for confusion 
with real data, organisational codes in this extract have been obfuscated.

For more information on the Simulacrum and guidance on use, please see

If you would like access to detailed, quality assured statistical cancer data,
